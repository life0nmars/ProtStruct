        ‧°𖦹｡ If you are struggling with nucleotides recognition, this page might be usefull ｡𖦹°‧
Firstly, we are remind you the composition of a nucleotide.
It contains three parts:
        <ul>
            <li> Nucleobase <\li>
            This part determins your nucleotide, it can be purine or pyrimidine. Interestingly, purin means <i> pure urine <\i>, because it was exctracted from urine,
            pyrimidin name comes from its exctraction method, namely, during synthesis, performed in high temperatures ('pyr' - fire). 
            <li> Five carbon sugar molecule <\li>
            Desoxyrebose stands for DNA and Ribose - for RNA. Together nucleobase with sugar forms <strong> nucleoside <\strong> (from glycoside bond)
            <li> Phosphate group <\li>
            This phosphate group is bonded to 5' atom of the sugar and here can be mono-, di- and triphosphates. Nomenclature names, therefore, would be nucleosid <b>mono/di/tri<\b>phosphate
        <\ul>
